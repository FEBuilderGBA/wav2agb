# wav2agb
"wav2agb" is a tool to convert standard .wav files to GBA compatible .s files

Another program of my GBA tool collection. Intended to convert .wav files for the use with the mp2k/m4a sound driver.

Usage: 
```
$ wav2agb input.wav output.s [-c]
```

Flag -c enables compression (only supported by Pokemon Games)
